This is an ASP.NET Core 5.0 Web API Project that adheres to the Repository Pattern.
Just clone the repo as it is and you can immediately try out the API using Swagger and an InMemory Database that is initialized
automatically on starting the application.
Note: For logging to work properly once the project has been downloaded, built and run, it will be necessary to edit the nlog.config file
to use the correct installation directory. This is self explanatory.
The application now includes both Unit Tests and Integration Tests.
