# CoffeeClub
This is an ASP.NET Core 5.0 Web API Project.
It contains a SQL create script that will create a SQL Server database 'CoffeeClub' which should be run first before running the project.
Alternatively, just clone the repo as it is and you can immediately try out the API using Swagger and an InMemory Database that is initialized
automatically on starting the application.
Note: For logging to work properly once the project has been downloaded, built and run, it will be necessary to edit the nlog.config file
to use the correct installation directory. This is self explanatory.
