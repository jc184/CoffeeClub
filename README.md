# CoffeeClub
This is an ASP.NET 5 Web API Project that is a submission for the coding assessment set by Recruitment Bunker on 28th September 2021.
It contains a SQL create script that will create a SQL Server database 'CoffeeClub' which should be run first before running the project.
Note: For logging to work properly once the project has been downloaded, built and run, it will be necessary to edit the nlog.config file
to use the correct installation directory. This is self explanatory.
